=== QuickStart ===

Install OpenStack Nova client tool:

  # yum -y install python-novaclient python-neutronclient python-heatclient python-cinderclient python-keystoneclient xmltodict lprettytable

Get config file:

  1. Login to OpenStack webUI
  2. Navigate to Access & Security -> API Access
  3. Save file from "Download OpenStack RC File" to ~/.5minute/config

Get started:

  Show help:

    $ ./5minute help

  Upload your SSH public key:

    $ ./5minute key ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

  Show images we can work with:

    $ ./5minute images

  Boot your machine (consider adding '--name' or '--flavor' to the command):

    $ ./5minute boot 5minute-RHEL6.6-x86-64

  When you are done, kill the machine (you can do it via OpenStack webUI,
  but this way we can clean DNS records much quicker):

    $ ./5minute delete $USER-5minute-RHEL6.6-x86-64-v2
